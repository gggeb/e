# math

this module is for performing vector and matrix calculations, general math
utilities and generating perspective matrices.

this module will draw heavy inspiration from cglm/glm

this module will implement the following types:

	+ EVec2, EVec3, EVec4 (floats)
	+ EMat2, EMat3, EMat4 (floats)

## vectors

	+ adding, scaling, rotating, dot products, cross products
	+ matrix transformations on vectors

## matrices

	+ adding, scaling, rotating, determinants, transposing, inversing
	+ generating perspective matrices and view matrices

## utilities

	+ rad2deg, ...
