# e

e is a simple game engine programmed in pure C with a goal of using as few
dependencies as possible (other than for context creation and OpenGL).

# goals

	+ (partially complete) linear maths
	+ resource loading
	+ entity/event systems
	+ advanced 3D rendering
	+ ...
	+ ...
	+ (very far off) scripting language

another goal is to use e to implement a game.
